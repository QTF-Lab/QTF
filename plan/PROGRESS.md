# Quant Framework: Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Quant Framework, detailing the work completed in each phase and outlining how each component will be used in subsequent stages.

---

## Phase 0 — Groundwork

### Goal

The primary goal of this phase was to establish the project's repository, including all necessary tooling, configuration, and documentation files.

### Completed Work

The foundational structure of the repository was created, establishing a professional development environment.

* **`pyproject.toml`**: Defines the project's metadata, dependencies, and configurations for development tools like `black`, `ruff`, and `mypy`.
* **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Configures pre-commit hooks that automatically run code formatters and linters before code is checked into version control.
* **`Makefile`**: Provides convenient shortcuts for common development tasks such as linting (`make lint`), testing (`make test`), and formatting (`make format`).
* **`README.md` & `PLAN.md`**: The core project documentation, outlining the framework's purpose, structure, and the step-by-step implementation plan.
* **`configs/`**: Contains the YAML configuration files (`base.yaml`, `research.yaml`) that control the framework's runtime behavior.

### Use in Continuation

The groundwork from this phase is the bedrock of the entire project. The `Makefile` commands will be used daily to maintain code quality. The configuration files will be expanded upon in future phases to manage data sources, strategies, and broker connections.

## Phase 1 — Core Contracts & Config

### Goal

To establish the fundamental data structures (`types`) and categorical values (`enums`) that will be used as a common language across the entire framework.

### Completed Work

The core data contracts were defined as simple, immutable dataclasses and enums, which are crucial for type safety and clarity.

* **`src/qt/types.py`**: Defines the essential data structures like `TargetPositions`, `Bar`, `Signal`, `Order`, `Fill`, and `Position`. These act as the "nouns" of the system.
* **`src/qt/enums.py`**: Defines finite sets of values like `Side`, `OrderType`, and `Interval`. Using enums prevents common errors associated with using plain strings.
* **`src/qt/config/settings.py`**: A placeholder for the centralized configuration loader was created.

### Use in Continuation

These types and enums form the universal language of the framework. They will be imported and used by almost every other module, ensuring that when a `Bar` or `Order` is passed from one part of the system to another, its structure is guaranteed.

## Phase 2 — Data Schema & Storage Abstraction

### Goal

To define the precise, low-level structure of the dataframes used in the system and to create a formal abstraction layer for how that data is stored and retrieved.

### Completed Work

A robust schema validation layer and a flexible storage interface were created.

* **`src/qt/data/schema.py`**: Uses `pandera` to create enforceable schemas for dataframes, ensuring any data entering the system conforms to the expected structure.
* **`src/qt/data/storage/base.py`**: Defines an abstract `Storage` class, which acts as a formal contract for any storage backend, ensuring all backends are interchangeable.
* **`src/qt/data/storage/parquet.py`**, **`duckdb.py`**, **`postgres.py`**: Placeholder implementations for each storage backend, inheriting from the `Storage` base class.

### Use in Continuation

The schemas will be used by the **Data Loader (Phase 3)** to validate dataframes upon reading. The storage abstractions will allow the loader to delegate the physical reading/writing of data to the correct backend based on the project configuration.

---

## Phase 5 — Feature Engineering & Signals

### Goal

To define the architectural skeleton for where all alpha-generating logic will reside, separating reusable calculations from specific trading signals.

### Completed Work

The file and package structure for features, signals, and machine learning labeling has been created with placeholder functions.

* **`src/qt/features/engineering.py`**: This file is intended for common, reusable feature calculations that can be shared across many strategies (e.g., `calculate_returns`, `calculate_sma`).
* **`src/qt/features/signals/`**: A new package was created to house different families of alpha signals. Placeholder modules like `momentum.py` and `mean_reversion.py` were created to hold more specific signal functions (e.g., `calculate_zscore`).
* **`src/qt/features/labeling/`**: A package for machine learning labeling techniques. The `triple_barrier.py` module was created as a placeholder for this advanced functionality.

### Use in Continuation

This phase provides the necessary imports for **Phase 6 (Strategy Interface)**. Even though the functions are just stubs, their existence allows the strategy development to proceed based on a clear, stable API. Strategies will use these functions on bulk `DataFrames` to pre-calculate signals before the backtest simulation begins.

---

## Phase 6 — Strategy Interface

### Goal

To freeze the communication "contract" between the trading engine and any user-defined strategy, and to create a "plug-in" system for discovering strategies.

### Completed Work

A formal strategy interface and a discovery mechanism have been created.

* **`src/qt/strategies/base.py`**: Defines the abstract `Strategy` class. This is the core of the phase, specifying the essential methods (`initialize`, `on_data`) and the output data contract (`TargetPositions`) that every strategy must use to be compatible with the trading engine.
* **`src/qt/strategies/registry.py`**: Implements a registry pattern with a `@register_strategy` decorator and a `get_strategy` function. This decouples the core engine from the specific strategy implementations, allowing strategies to be loaded by name from a config file.
* **`src/qt/strategies/sma_crossover.py`**: Example strategy was created. It correctly inherits from the `Strategy` base class and registers itself with the registry, serving as a template for future development.

### Use in Continuation

This interface is fundamental for all subsequent phases. The **Portfolio Construction (Phase 7)**, **Risk (Phase 8)**, and **Backtest Engine (Phase 9)** layers will all be built on the assumption that they will receive a `TargetPositions` dictionary from a class that conforms to this `Strategy` interface. The backtesting script will use `get_strategy("some_name")` to load a strategy and then drive the simulation by calling its `initialize()` and `on_data()` methods.
