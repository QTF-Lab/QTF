# Quant Framework: Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Quant Framework, detailing the work completed in each phase and outlining how each component will be used in subsequent stages.

---

## Phase 0 — Groundwork

### Goal

The primary goal of this phase was to establish the project's repository, including all necessary tooling, configuration, and documentation files.

### Completed Work

The foundational structure of the repository was created, establishing a professional development environment.

* **`pyproject.toml`**: Defines the project's metadata, dependencies, and configurations for development tools like `black`, `ruff`, and `mypy`.
* **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Configures pre-commit hooks that automatically run code formatters and linters before code is checked into version control.
* **`Makefile`**: Provides convenient shortcuts for common development tasks such as linting (`make lint`), testing (`make test`), and formatting (`make format`).
* **`README.md` & `PLAN.md`**: The core project documentation, outlining the framework's purpose, structure, and the step-by-step implementation plan.
* **`configs/`**: Contains the YAML configuration files (`base.yaml`, `research.yaml`) that control the framework's runtime behavior.

### Use in Continuation

The groundwork from this phase is the bedrock of the entire project. The `Makefile` commands will be used daily to maintain code quality. The configuration files will be expanded upon in future phases to manage data sources, strategies, and broker connections.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Contracts & Config

### Goal

To establish the fundamental data structures (`types`) and categorical values (`enums`) that will be used as a common language across the entire framework.

### Completed Work

The core data contracts were defined as simple, immutable dataclasses and enums, which are crucial for type safety and clarity.

* **`src/qt/types.py`**: Defines the essential data structures like `Bar`, `Signal`, `Order`, `Fill`, and `Position`. These act as the "nouns" of the system.
* **`src/qt/enums.py`**: Defines finite sets of values like `Side`, `OrderType`, and `Interval`. Using enums prevents common errors associated with using plain strings.
* **`src/qt/config/settings.py`**: A placeholder for the centralized configuration loader was created.

### Use in Continuation

These types and enums form the universal language of the framework. They will be imported and used by almost every other module, ensuring that when a `Bar` or `Order` is passed from one part of the system to another, its structure is guaranteed.

---

## Phase 2 — Data Schema & Storage Abstraction

### Goal

To define the precise, low-level structure of the dataframes used in the system and to create a formal abstraction layer for how that data is stored and retrieved.

### Completed Work

A robust schema validation layer and a flexible storage interface were created.

* **`src/qt/data/schema.py`**: Uses `pandera` to create enforceable schemas for dataframes, ensuring any data entering the system conforms to the expected structure.
* **`src/qt/data/storage/base.py`**: Defines an abstract `Storage` class, which acts as a formal contract for any storage backend, ensuring all backends are interchangeable.
* **`src/qt/data/storage/parquet.py`**, **`duckdb.py`**, **`postgres.py`**: Placeholder implementations for each storage backend, inheriting from the `Storage` base class.

### Use in Continuation

The schemas will be used by the **Data Loader (Phase 3)** to validate dataframes upon reading. The storage abstractions will allow the loader to delegate the physical reading/writing of data to the correct backend based on the project configuration.

---

## Phase 5 — Feature Engineering & Signals

### Goal

To define the architectural skeleton for where all alpha-generating logic will reside, separating reusable calculations from specific trading signals.

### Completed Work

The file and package structure for features, signals, and machine learning labeling has been created with placeholder functions.

* **`src/qt/features/engineering.py`**: This file is intended for common, reusable feature calculations that can be shared across many strategies (e.g., `calculate_returns`, `calculate_sma`).
* **`src/qt/features/signals/`**: A new package was created to house different families of alpha signals. Placeholder modules like `momentum.py` and `mean_reversion.py` were created.
* **`src/qt/features/labeling/`**: A package for machine learning labeling techniques, with a placeholder for the `triple_barrier.py` method.

### Use in Continuation

This phase provides the necessary imports for **Phase 6 (Strategy Interface)**. Strategies will use these functions on bulk `DataFrames` to pre-calculate signals before the backtest simulation begins.

---

## Phase 6 — Strategy Interface

### Goal

To freeze the communication "contract" between the trading engine and any user-defined strategy, and to create a "plug-in" system for discovering strategies.

### Completed Work

A formal strategy interface and a discovery mechanism have been created.

* **`src/qt/strategies/base.py`**: Defines the abstract `Strategy` class, specifying the essential methods (`initialize`, `on_data`) and the output data contract (`TargetPositions`).
* **`src/qt/strategies/registry.py`**: Implements a registry pattern (`@register_strategy`) to decouple the core engine from specific strategy implementations.
* **`src/qt/strategies/xmom_crosssec.py` & `mr_pairs.py`**: Skeleton files for example strategies were created, serving as templates.

### Use in Continuation

This interface is fundamental for all subsequent phases. The **Backtest Engine (Phase 9)** will use `get_strategy()` to load a strategy, then call its `initialize()` and `on_data()` methods to receive the `TargetPositions` that will be passed to the portfolio layer.

---

## Phase 7 — Portfolio Construction

### Goal

To create the architectural layer responsible for translating a strategy's raw target weights into a final, optimized set of target weights, incorporating risk models and constraints.

### Completed Work

The package and module skeletons for the entire portfolio construction pipeline have been created, defining their APIs.

* **`src/qt/portfolio/`**: A new package to house all portfolio-level logic.
* **`src/qt/portfolio/optimizers.py`**: Defines the `Optimizer` abstract base class and a simple `PassThroughOptimizer`.
* **`src/qt/portfolio/risk_models.py`**: Defines the `RiskModel` abstract base class, which will be responsible for calculating covariance matrices.
* **`src/qt/portfolio/constraints.py`**: Contains placeholders for functions that will enforce portfolio-level rules.
* **`src/qt/portfolio/rebalancing.py`**: Holds placeholders for logic that determines *when* to rebalance.
* **`src/qt/portfolio/allocators.py`**: Includes stubs for multi-strategy allocation logic.

### Use in Continuation

This layer acts as the bridge between the strategy and the final execution logic. The **Backtest Engine (Phase 9)** will take the `TargetPositions` from the strategy and feed them into an `Optimizer`. The output will then be passed to the **Risk & Sizing layer (Phase 8)**.

---

## Phase 8 — Risk (sizing & limits)

### Goal

To create the final architectural layer that converts an optimized portfolio blueprint (`TargetPositions`) into concrete, tradable `Orders`, while enforcing absolute, real-world risk limits.

### Completed Work

The file and package structure for the entire risk and order generation pipeline has been created with placeholder functions.

* **`src/qt/risk/`**: A new package to house all risk management logic.
* **`src/qt/risk/sizing.py`**: Contains the function stubs (`calculate_target_quantities`, `generate_orders`) responsible for the core logic of converting target weights into the final list of `Orders`.
* **`src/qt/risk/limits.py`**: Includes placeholders for pre-trade and post-trade risk checks (e.g., max exposure, drawdown limits), acting as the final safety layer before execution.
* **`src/qt/risk/models.py`**: Holds stubs for portfolio-level risk metrics like Value-at-Risk (VaR) for ongoing monitoring.
* **`src/qt/risk/stress.py`**: Includes stubs for simulating portfolio performance under extreme market scenarios.

### Use in Continuation

This is the final component in the pre-trade pipeline. The **Backtest Engine (Phase 9)** will call this layer after the Portfolio Construction layer. It will take the optimized weights, the current portfolio state, and market prices as input. Its output—the final `List[Order]`—is what will be sent to the execution simulator to be filled.

---

## Phase 9 — Backtest Engine

### Goal

To create the central orchestrator of the framework: a deterministic, event-driven engine that simulates a strategy's performance over historical data by wiring together all previously built components.

### Completed Work

The architectural skeleton for the entire backtesting pipeline has been created, achieving the "Hello World" milestone from the `PLAN.md`.

* **`src/qt/backtest/`**: A new package was created to house all components related to simulation.
* **`src/qt/backtest/engine.py`**: Defines the main `BacktestEngine` class. This is the heart of the simulation, containing the high-level logic for the event loop that drives the entire process.
* **`src/qt/backtest/portfolio.py`**: Defines the stateful `Portfolio` class, which is responsible for tracking cash, positions, and calculating the portfolio's Net Asset Value (NAV) over time.
* **`src/qt/backtest/execution_sim.py`**: Defines the `ExecutionSimulator` class, which is responsible for taking `Order` objects and generating realistic `Fill` events, considering market conditions.
* **`src/qt/backtest/slippage.py` & `costs.py`**: These modules define the interfaces for modeling real-world trading frictions like slippage and commissions.
* **`src/qt/backtest/metrics.py`**: Contains placeholder functions for calculating final performance statistics like the Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Drawdown from the portfolio's equity curve.
* **`scripts/run_backtest.py`**: A user-facing command-line script was created. This script is the final entry point that loads a strategy by name, initializes all the necessary backtesting components, and runs the engine.

### Use in Continuation

This phase provides the complete, runnable skeleton of the trading system. The next major step is to begin filling in the `NotImplementedError` stubs within these modules. This involves:
1.  Implementing the data loading logic (Phases 3 & 4) so that `historical_data` is populated.
2.  Implementing the core event loop in `engine.py` to iterate through time.
3.  Implementing the state update logic in `portfolio.py` and the fill simulation in `execution_sim.py`.
4.  Once the simulation runs and produces an equity curve, the `metrics.py` functions can be implemented to generate the final performance report.
