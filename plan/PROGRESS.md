# Quant Framework: Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Quant Framework, detailing the work completed in each phase and outlining how each component will be used in subsequent stages.

---

## Phase 0 — Groundwork

### Goal

The primary goal of this phase was to establish the project's repository, including all necessary tooling, configuration, and documentation files.

### Completed Work

The foundational structure of the repository was created, establishing a professional development environment.

* **`pyproject.toml`**: Defines the project's metadata, dependencies, and configurations for development tools like `black`, `ruff`, and `mypy`.
* **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Configures pre-commit hooks that automatically run code formatters and linters before code is checked into version control.
* **`Makefile`**: Provides convenient shortcuts for common development tasks such as linting (`make lint`), testing (`make test`), and formatting (`make format`).
* **`README.md` & `PLAN.md`**: The core project documentation, outlining the framework's purpose, structure, and the step-by-step implementation plan.
* **`configs/`**: Contains the YAML configuration files (`base.yaml`, `research.yaml`) that control the framework's runtime behavior.

### Use in Continuation

The groundwork from this phase is the bedrock of the entire project. The `Makefile` commands will be used daily to maintain code quality. The configuration files will be expanded upon in future phases to manage data sources, strategies, and broker connections.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Contracts & Config

### Goal

To establish the fundamental data structures (`types`) and categorical values (`enums`) that will be used as a common language across the entire framework.

### Completed Work

The core data contracts were defined as simple, immutable dataclasses and enums, which are crucial for type safety and clarity.

* **`src/qt/types.py`**: Defines the essential data structures like `Bar`, `Signal`, `Order`, `Fill`, and `Position`. These act as the "nouns" of the system.
* **`src/qt/enums.py`**: Defines finite sets of values like `Side`, `OrderType`, and `Interval`. Using enums prevents common errors associated with using plain strings.
* **`src/qt/config/settings.py`**: A placeholder for the centralized configuration loader was created.

### Use in Continuation

These types and enums form the universal language of the framework. They will be imported and used by almost every other module, ensuring that when a `Bar` or `Order` is passed from one part of the system to another, its structure is guaranteed.

---

## Phase 2 — Data Schema & Storage Abstraction

### Goal

To define the precise, low-level structure of the dataframes used in the system and to create a formal abstraction layer for how that data is stored and retrieved.

### Completed Work

A robust schema validation layer and a flexible storage interface were created.

* **`src/qt/data/schema.py`**: Uses `pandera` to create enforceable schemas for dataframes, ensuring any data entering the system conforms to the expected structure.
* **`src/qt/data/storage/base.py`**: Defines an abstract `Storage` class, which acts as a formal contract for any storage backend, ensuring all backends are interchangeable.
* **`src/qt/data/storage/parquet.py`**, **`duckdb.py`**, **`postgres.py`**: Placeholder implementations for each storage backend, inheriting from the `Storage` base class.

### Use in Continuation

The schemas will be used by the **Data Loader (Phase 3)** to validate dataframes upon reading. The storage abstractions will allow the loader to delegate the physical reading/writing of data to the correct backend based on the project configuration.

---

## Phase 5 — Feature Engineering & Signals

### Goal

To define the architectural skeleton for where all alpha-generating logic will reside, separating reusable calculations from specific trading signals.

### Completed Work

The file and package structure for features, signals, and machine learning labeling has been created with placeholder functions.

* **`src/qt/features/engineering.py`**: This file is intended for common, reusable feature calculations that can be shared across many strategies.
* **`src/qt/features/signals/`**: A new package was created to house different families of alpha signals. Placeholder modules like `momentum.py` and `mean_reversion.py` were created.
* **`src/qt/features/labeling/`**: A package for machine learning labeling techniques, with a placeholder for the `triple_barrier.py` method.

### Use in Continuation

This phase provides the necessary imports for **Phase 6 (Strategy Interface)**. Strategies will use these functions on bulk `DataFrames` to pre-calculate signals before the backtest simulation begins.

---

## Phase 6 — Strategy Interface

### Goal

To freeze the communication "contract" between the trading engine and any user-defined strategy, and to create a "plug-in" system for discovering strategies.

### Completed Work

A formal strategy interface and a discovery mechanism have been created.

* **`src/qt/strategies/base.py`**: Defines the abstract `Strategy` class, specifying the essential methods (`initialize`, `on_data`) and the output data contract (`TargetPositions`).
* **`src/qt/strategies/registry.py`**: Implements a registry pattern (`@register_strategy`) to decouple the core engine from specific strategy implementations.
* **`src/qt/strategies/xmom_crosssec.py` & `mr_pairs.py`**: Skeleton files for example strategies were created, serving as templates.

### Use in Continuation

This interface is fundamental for all subsequent phases. The **Backtest Engine (Phase 9)** will use `get_strategy()` to load a strategy, then call its `initialize()` and `on_data()` methods to receive the `TargetPositions` that will be passed to the portfolio layer.

---

## Phase 7 — Portfolio Construction

### Goal

To create the architectural layer responsible for translating a strategy's raw target weights into a final, optimized set of target weights, incorporating risk models and constraints.

### Completed Work

The package and module skeletons for the entire portfolio construction pipeline have been created, defining their APIs.

* **`src/qt/portfolio/`**: A new package to house all portfolio-level logic.
* **`src/qt/portfolio/optimizers.py`**: Defines the `Optimizer` abstract base class and a simple `PassThroughOptimizer`.
* **`src/qt/portfolio/risk_models.py`**: Defines the `RiskModel` abstract base class for calculating covariance matrices.
* **`src/qt/portfolio/constraints.py`**: Contains placeholders for functions that will enforce portfolio-level rules.
* **`src/qt/portfolio/rebalancing.py`**: Holds placeholders for logic that determines *when* to rebalance.
* **`src/qt/portfolio/allocators.py`**: Includes stubs for multi-strategy allocation logic.

### Use in Continuation

This layer acts as the bridge between the strategy and the final execution logic. The **Backtest Engine (Phase 9)** will take the `TargetPositions` from the strategy and feed them into an `Optimizer`. The output will then be passed to the **Risk & Sizing layer (Phase 8)**.

---

## Phase 8 — Risk (sizing & limits)

### Goal

To create the final architectural layer that converts an optimized portfolio blueprint (`TargetPositions`) into concrete, tradable `Orders`, while enforcing absolute, real-world risk limits.

### Completed Work

The file and package structure for the entire risk and order generation pipeline has been created with placeholder functions.

* **`src/qt/risk/`**: A new package to house all risk management logic.
* **`src/qt/risk/sizing.py`**: Contains the function stubs responsible for the core logic of converting target weights into the final list of `Orders`.
* **`src/qt/risk/limits.py`**: Includes placeholders for pre-trade and post-trade risk checks, acting as the final safety layer.
* **`src/qt/risk/models.py`**: Holds stubs for portfolio-level risk metrics like Value-at-Risk (VaR).
* **`src/qt/risk/stress.py`**: Includes stubs for simulating portfolio performance under extreme market scenarios.

### Use in Continuation

This is the final component in the pre-trade pipeline. The **Backtest Engine (Phase 9)** will call this layer after the Portfolio Construction layer. Its output—the final `List[Order]`—is what will be sent to the execution simulator to be filled.

---

## Phase 9 — Backtest Engine Implementation

### Goal

To implement and test the core components of the deterministic, event-driven backtesting engine, bringing the simulation to life.

### Completed Work

This phase has moved beyond architectural skeletons to a fully implemented and tested simulation core.

* **`src/qt/events.py`**: A robust, batch-oriented event system (`BarEvent`, `OrderEvent`, `FillEvent`) was designed and implemented to ensure correct chronological processing of multi-asset data.
* **`src/qt/backtest/event_queue.py`**: A time-based priority queue was implemented using `heapq` to drive the entire event loop.
* **`src/qt/backtest/data_handler.py`**: A stateful data handler was fully implemented. It correctly processes historical data, generates bundled `BarEvent` objects, and provides strategies with a point-in-time, lookahead-bias-safe view of the market.
* **`src/qt/backtest/portfolio.py`**: The stateful `Portfolio` class was fully implemented. Its accounting logic correctly handles opening, closing, and flipping both long and short positions while tracking cash and realized P&L.
* **`src/qt/backtest/execution_sim.py`**: A stateful `ExecutionSimulator` was implemented. It correctly simulates the filling of both `MARKET` and `LIMIT` orders by maintaining an internal book of open limit orders.
* **`src/qt/backtest/engine.py`**: The main `BacktestEngine` was implemented. Its event loop correctly orchestrates all the above components, routing events to the appropriate handlers. A simplified order generation logic was included as a placeholder for the full Phase 7/8 pipeline.
* **`tests/`**: The core components (`DataHandler`, `Portfolio`, `ExecutionSimulator`) are all covered by comprehensive unit tests. A full end-to-end integration test (`test_backtest_engine.py`) was written and passed, verifying that the entire pipeline works as expected.

### Use in Continuation

The core simulation engine is now complete and verified. The immediate next steps are to replace the placeholder components with real logic:
1.  Integrate the real **Data Layer (Phases 3 & 4)** to feed the engine with actual historical data.
2.  Implement real alpha logic in the **Strategy classes (Phase 6)**.
3.  Replace the simplified order generation in the engine with the full **Portfolio Construction and Risk Management pipeline (Phases 7 & 8)**.

## Phase 10 — Evaluation & Reporting

### Goal

To define and structure the outputs of the research and backtesting process, enabling deep analysis and clear communication of results.

### Completed Work

The architectural skeletons for performance analysis, visual reporting, and notifications have been created.

* **`src/qt/evaluation/performance.py`**: A library for advanced performance calculations beyond the basic metrics.
* **`src/qt/evaluation/tearsheet.py`**: A module designed to generate comprehensive visual reports (tearsheets) from backtest results.
* **`src/qt/reporting/reporters.py`**: Skeletons for sending notifications, for example, to Slack or email upon backtest completion.
* **`scripts/make_tearsheet.py`**: A user-facing script to generate a report from a saved backtest artifact.

### Use in Continuation

After a backtest is run with real data and strategies, the resulting equity curve and trade logs will be fed into the functions in this phase to analyze performance and generate reports, completing the research cycle.

---

## Phase 11 — Live Trading Surface

### Goal

To create the "live twin" of the backtest engine, allowing a strategy to be deployed in a real-time trading environment with minimal changes.

### Completed Work

The complete architectural skeleton for the live trading engine and its components has been created.

* **`src/qt/live/exec_engine.py`**: Defines the `LiveTradingEngine`, which will host the event loop driven by real-time market data.
* **`src/qt/live/data_streams.py`**: Defines the interface for connecting to live broker data feeds.
* **`src/qt/live/order_router.py`**: Defines the interface for sending orders to a broker and managing their lifecycle.
* **`src/qt/live/state_store.py`**: Defines the interface for a persistent state manager to ensure positions are not lost on restart.
* **`src/qt/live/risk_guard.py`**: A final, live pre-trade risk check module.
* **`src/qt/live/adapters/`**: A package to hold broker-specific implementations.
* **`scripts/run_live.py`**: A user-facing script to launch a strategy in a live environment.

### Use in Continuation

This is the final deployment layer. Once a strategy has been thoroughly vetted through backtesting, the `run_live.py` script will be used to launch it. The live engine will use the exact same `Strategy`, `Portfolio`, and `Risk` components, but will swap out the historical data feed and execution simulator for live broker connections via the `adapters`.
