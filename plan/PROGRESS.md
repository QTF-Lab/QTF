# Quant Framework: Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Quant Framework, detailing the work completed in each phase and outlining how each component will be used in subsequent stages.

## Phase 0 — Groundwork

### Goal

The primary goal of this phase was to establish the project's repository, including all necessary tooling, configuration, and documentation files.

### Completed Work

The foundational structure of the repository was created, establishing a professional development environment.

* **`pyproject.toml`**: Defines the project's metadata, dependencies, and configurations for development tools like `black`, `ruff`, and `mypy`. This is the central configuration file for the Python project itself.

* **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Configures pre-commit hooks that automatically run code formatters and linters before code is checked into version control, ensuring a consistent code style across the project.

* **`Makefile`**: Provides convenient shortcuts for common development tasks such as linting (`make lint`), testing (`make test`), and formatting (`make format`). This simplifies the developer workflow.

* **`README.md` & `PLAN.md`**: The core project documentation, outlining the framework's purpose, structure, and the step-by-step implementation plan that guides the development process.

* **`configs/`**: Contains the YAML configuration files (`base.yaml`, `research.yaml`) that control the framework's runtime behavior, allowing for easy adjustments without changing the code.

### Use in Continuation

The groundwork from this phase is the bedrock of the entire project. The `Makefile` commands will be used daily to maintain code quality. The configuration files will be expanded upon in future phases to manage data sources, strategies, and broker connections.

## Phase 1 — Core Contracts & Config

### Goal

To establish the fundamental data structures (`types`) and categorical values (`enums`) that will be used as a common language across the entire framework.

### Completed Work

The core data contracts were defined as simple, immutable dataclasses and enums, which are crucial for type safety and clarity.

* **`src/qt/types.py`**: Defines the essential data structures like `Bar`, `Signal`, `Order`, `Fill`, and `Position`. These act as the "nouns" of the system, representing the data that flows between different components.

* **`src/qt/enums.py`**: Defines finite sets of values like `Side`, `OrderType`, and `Interval`. Using enums prevents common and hard-to-debug errors associated with using plain strings for categorical data.

* **`src/qt/config/settings.py`**: A placeholder for the centralized configuration loader was created, which will eventually load settings from the YAML files and environment variables.

### Use in Continuation

These types and enums form the universal language of the framework. They will be imported and used by almost every other module, from the data loader to the backtesting engine and live trading components. This ensures that when a `Bar` or `Order` is passed from one part of the system to another, its structure is guaranteed.

## Phase 2 — Data Schema & Storage Abstraction

### Goal

To define the precise, low-level structure of the dataframes used in the system and to create a formal abstraction layer for how that data is stored and retrieved.

### Completed Work

A robust schema validation layer and a flexible storage interface were created.

* **`src/qt/data/schema.py`**: This file uses the `pandera` library to create enforceable schemas for dataframes. Its job is to ensure that any data entering the system (e.g., from a CSV file or an API) conforms to the expected structure (column names, data types, etc.), preventing data quality issues from corrupting the system.

* **`src/qt/data/storage/base.py`**: Defines an abstract base class, `Storage`, which acts as a formal contract or interface for any storage backend. This is the key to the "adapter" philosophy mentioned in the `README.md`, ensuring all storage backends are interchangeable.

* **`src/qt/data/storage/parquet.py`**, **`duckdb.py`**, **`postgres.py`**: These files contain the initial, empty implementations for each storage backend. They inherit from the `Storage` base class and define the required read/write methods, which are currently stubbed with `NotImplementedError`.

### Use in Continuation

This phase is critical for the next steps. The schemas from `schema.py` will be used directly in **Phase 3 (Data Loader)** to validate dataframes immediately after they are read. The storage abstractions will allow the loader to delegate the actual reading and writing of data to the appropriate backend (e.g., `ParquetStorage` or `PostgresStorage`), which will be selected via the project's configuration files. This decouples the logic of *what* data to get from the logic of *how* it is stored.
